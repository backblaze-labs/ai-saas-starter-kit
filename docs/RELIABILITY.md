# Reliability

Reliability expectations and practices for this project.

## Health Checks

- `GET /health` verifies B2 connectivity and returns `healthy` or `degraded`
- Health endpoint is always available, even when B2 is down

## Error Handling

- HTTP handlers return structured error responses with appropriate status codes
- External service failures (B2) are caught and surfaced as 500/503 responses
- No unhandled exceptions leak stack traces to clients
- Uncaught exceptions are converted to a typed JSON 500 (`{"detail": "Internal server error"}`, modeled by `app.types.ErrorResponse`) by the catch-all in `timing_middleware`
- **Error responses carry CORS headers.** `CORSMiddleware` is registered LAST in `main.py` so it is the outermost middleware and wraps every response — including uncaught-exception 500s produced by the inner catch-all. This is intentional and load-bearing: if a 500 shipped without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, the browser would block it and the frontend would surface only an opaque "network error", hiding the real server bug. Regression-guarded by `tests/test_error_handling.py::test_unhandled_exception_500_carries_cors_headers`.

## Logging

- Structured JSON logging via Python stdlib
- Every request gets a `request_id` for tracing
- Log levels: ERROR for failures, WARNING for degraded state, INFO for requests

## Observability

- Request timing middleware logs duration for every request
- `/metrics` endpoint exposes basic Prometheus-format counters
- Upload success/failure counts tracked

## Stateful Counters — durability caveats

The download counter and the `/metrics` counters are **in-process, per replica**. Consequences to plan for before scaling:

- **Download counter** (`app/repo/counter.py`) persists to a JSON file at `DOWNLOAD_COUNT_FILE` (default `data/download_count.json`). On an ephemeral filesystem (Railway without a mounted volume) it **resets to 0 on every redeploy**. With multiple replicas each keeps its own file/count. For durable, shared counts: mount a persistent volume, or swap the adapter for Redis/DB.
- **`/metrics` counters** live in process memory and reset on restart. Behind a load balancer, each replica reports only its own slice — scrape with an instance label and aggregate, or push to a shared collector.

## Rate Limiting

- Per-IP fixed-window limiter (`app/runtime/ratelimit.py`); `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` / `RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_PER_MINUTE` are the budgets. Rejected requests get `429` with a `Retry-After` header.
- Counters are in-process per replica; horizontal scaling needs a shared store (e.g. Redis) for a global limit.

## Graceful Degradation

- File listing returns empty list (not error) when B2 has no objects
- A failed browser→B2 upload leaves no server state; the client surfaces the error and the row stays retryable
- Frontend shows skeleton states while loading, error states on failure

## Deployment

- Railway health checks on `/health`
- Zero-downtime deploys via rolling updates
- Environment-specific configuration via env vars (no config files in prod)
